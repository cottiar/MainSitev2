            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked with Srikanth for over 6 years as a member of my Consulting team. Srikanth is a self-motivated, highly conscientious
            and highly skilled individual who always delivers the highest quality of work and work effort. He has consistently demonstrated tremendous focus,
            drive and commitment. He has excellent technical and inter-personal skills and a consistently demonstrated talent for working with the most difficult clients.
            Srikanth has excellent time management skills and always delivers in timely and consistent fashion.
            Srikanth would be a tremendous asset to any organization fortunate enough to have him aboard and I would recommend him without hesitation.

Whether working together in the HQ offices, on travels to locations abroad, or remotely via online meetings, it has been easy to get his cooperation, his analytical acumen, his technical expertise and his commitment focused on the job to be done. I can absolutely recommend to have Srikanth on your team as an integration architect.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Srikanth was one of the key persons in a large migration project, where a huge set of interfaces was migrated towards the new integration platform based on SAP PI. 
            He was the creator of many solution designs of business critical interfaces, identified and resolved issues upfront, and drive these solution designs to implementation (with the offshore team) and go-live in the new SAP PI environment. 
            He was very dedicated and constructive in the way he executed his job. He was very eager to learn new techniques and use them in the best possible way. 
            He was able to manage his large number of activities that took place at the same time and make progress. He was realistic in his planning and is an excellent communicator, both in speech and in writing.

             I have observed that Srikanth's pursuit of perfection in his work is noteworthy.Also,Srikanth is a keen observer and his dedication levels and zeal to learn new things are worth mentioning. 
             Srikanth's attitude is his main strength and his courteous nature and friendly smile makes him an easy entrant into any group. Srikanth, in my opinion, will be a big name in the SAP world , in the next 5- 10 years.
